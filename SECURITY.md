## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers have had an opportunity to validate and remediate them.

To report a vulnerability:
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hmlendea/universal-name-generator-api/security/advisories)
- Contact the maintainers directly

## 📌 Scope

The subsequent report categories are in scope for this repository:
- API authentication and authorisation, including API-key handling and access-control bypasses
- Input validation, HTTP middleware, dependency handling, and exposure of configured secrets or data-store files

The subsequent categories are out of scope unless explicitly stated to the contrary:
- Vulnerabilities requiring access to maintainer infrastructure, private credentials, or unavailable third-party systems
- Generated name content, ordinary service errors, and reports without a reproducible security impact

## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:
1. Vulnerabilities are investigated privately.
2. A remediation plan is prepared and validated.
3. Public disclosure is published after a fix, mitigation, or agreed risk decision is available.
4. Credit is attributed in accordance with reporter preference and project policy.
